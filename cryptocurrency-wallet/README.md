# Creating Cryptocurrency wallet with Web3

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a react application used to view your cryptocurrency balance of an account and also transfer some token to another account. In this application we will be making use of a custom crypto token called `Nice Token` but the concept would remain pretty much the same as communicating with Ethereum. 

We make use of `Web3` dependency to communicate with a local Blockcaain Network called [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/). 

Using Web3, we can view the current account balance and also transfer tokens from one account to another. 

You can first run the build using the following command :

- `npm run build`

    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Next, you can start the application using the folowing command: 
- `npm start`

    This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
